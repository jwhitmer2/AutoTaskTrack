# Palendar
This is a project that was started for our software development class. It is a calendar application that allows the user to add several items spanning several dates into their calendar at one time by uploading a PDF or txt file, or by a simple copy and paste into the text box. The user can also upload an image file containing items to be put into the calendar using an OCR algorithm. We are currently working on a way to sync this calendar to Apple and Google's calendars so you can use our functionality with your existing calendars, as well as working on improving the image processing, which can be inaccurate with small font sizes.
